# COVID19_Chicago

In this final group project for our Data Engineering Platforms course at the University of Chicago, we obtained a series of publicly available datasets from the city of Chicago in order to analyze COVID-19 case, death and vaccination trends, while evaluating the interactions between these numbers and a few other factors including the density of vaccination and testing locations by zip code and age group. After some data cleaning in excel, we decided that our data was best suited for a dimensional model. We imported our data into SQL to create a model then accessed the model through Tableau and created some visualizations.

The C19_Chicago_DDL file shows the code used to create the database and the C19_Chicago_DML file shows the code used to populate the database.

The Functionality_Business_Questions file demonstrates a couple of examples of how the database we created can be used to answer various questions about the effect of and response to COVID-19 in Chicago.
